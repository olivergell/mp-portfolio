                    <p>We focused on colour theory and how colour makes a page or website look better and how your photography can change the colour used throughout the website.</p>
<p>We change the colours of some of the things on the website just to practice this so in the future we can change it to the final colours. Within the lecture we also had an introduction to audio and how to use the mics and audio equipment, we practiced by doing a short interview with our groups for the main project about any topic</p>
<p>This allowed me to develop my knowledge on colour theory and how I can apply that too my website, giving it a cohesive look that I appealing to the viewer. This also allowed our group to have some practise with audio equipment so that when it come to the final interview we have already experienced how to setup and use the equipment. </p>

<p>In practicing the editing it has allowed us as a group to have the basic skills to edit our interview that that crucial two minutes, making our future efforts easier as we already have some knowledge.</p>

                    <p>For this digital Wednesday we did a padlet questionnaire that asked me to reflect on our past work and what we have learnt at the start of this week.</p>

                    <p>In today's lecture we added code snippets to our website, which added a new layer to our pages, it allows us to add pictures and text to the page we desire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This allows me to add more to my website and make it look more professional by adding the code snippets it allows me to add pictures and text in the future for my final products. </p>

<p>It gave me the option to choose whether I wanted an info graphic but will allow me to use these skills in the future if I did ever want to add an info graphic.</p>

                        <p>In groups we practiced setting up the camera and video equipment to practiced making our own news edit, and we then practiced editing it together to look like there a two camera operation.</p>
<p>I can apply this when filming my final video interview ass we covered how to operate the camera and as a group we can all implement skills that we learned to apply them to the final video interview </p>

<p>This allowed me to see what the best fit for the video was and where on the page I would like it, it also gave me the knowledge of how to embed video for when I come to embed my final video interview.</p>

<p>A guest speaker called Kevin Palmer who is a sports journalist came in to speak about his experience when getting interview and news stories about people.</p>
<p>Made my website flow a lot better and making it more accessible throughout the pages including links to different pages, making it easy to navigate. I applied the things I learned from Kevin into our own interview when editing and coming to the final product.</p>
